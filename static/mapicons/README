These icons are used by many of my google maps travel guides.
Icons are name by the type of establishment and whether this is a "to try" place or an already tried place.

I have intentionlly not name the icons with the colors they use to allow for changing the colors later.

For now, here are the colors:

Food: (red: FF0000)
  - includes places to eat, cafes, fast food, grocery, etc

Stores (grey: b8b8b8):
  - places to shop for clothes, stationary, toys, etc

Sites (blue: 0000FF):
  - things to go see like landmarks, temples, etc.  more things to photography and check out from the outside

Activities (green: 339900):
  - things to do, like hang out in a park, take a bike ride, go to a musuem etc

Places to try (yellow: FFFF00):
  - look at the icon to know what it is, but it is a place to try
